Collaborative simultaneous localization and mapping (CSLAM) is essential for autonomous aerial swarms, laying the foundation for downstream algorithms such as planning and control. To address existing CSLAM systems' limitations in relative localization accuracy, crucial for close-range UAV collaboration, this paper introduces $D^2$SLAMâ€”a novel decentralized and distributed CSLAM system. $D^2$SLAM innovatively manages near-field estimation for precise relative state estimation in proximity and far-field estimation for consistent global trajectories. Its adaptable front-end supports both stereo and omnidirectional cameras, catering to various operational needs and overcoming field-of-view challenges in aerial swarms. Experiments demonstrate $D^2$SLAM's effectiveness in accurate ego-motion estimation, relative localization, and global consistency. Enhanced by distributed optimization algorithms, $D^2$SLAM exhibits remarkable scalability and resilience to network delays, making it well-suited for a wide range of real-world aerial swarm applications. The adaptability and proven performance of $D^2$SLAM represent a significant advancement in autonomous aerial swarm technology.
